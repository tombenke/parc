# parc

parc is a [Parser Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator) written in Golang.

It mainly inspired by the [Arcsecond](https://github.com/francisrstokes/arcsecond) library.
Many ideas are also borrowed from the 
[How Parser Combinators Work, Parser Combinators From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQLRhw5Ah0&t=185s)
youtube series of Low Byte Productions,
and the presentation of Jeremy Brown at GopherCon 2022: on _Parsing w/o Code Generators: Parser Combinators in Go with Generics_.

See the [examples/](examples/) to get started with this package.
